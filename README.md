# Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
The task is to perform prediction on Iris dataset using Decision TreeClassifier.Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.

Gini impurity is used over here,as it is  computationally more efficient.
Formula for the Gini index is Gini(P) = 1 – ∑(Px)^2 , where Pi is the proportion of the instances of class x in a set.
